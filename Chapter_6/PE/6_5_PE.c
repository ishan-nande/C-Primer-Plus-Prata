/*
Have a program request the user to enter an uppercase letter. Use nested loops to produce
a pyramid pattern like this:
    A
   ABA
  ABCBA
 ABCDCBA
ABCDEDCBA
The pattern should extend to the character entered. For example, the preceding pattern
would result from an input value of E . Hint: Use an outer loop to handle the rows. Use
three inner loops in a row, one to handle the spaces, one for printing letters in ascending
order, and one for printing letters in descending order. If your system doesnâ€™t use ASCII
or a similar system that represents letters in strict number order, see the suggestion in
programming exercise 3.
