The scarlet myzomela or scarlet honeyeater (Myzomela sanguinolenta) is a small passerine bird of the honeyeater family Meliphagidae native to Australia.
It was described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801.
At 9 to 11 centimetres (3.5 to 4.3 in) long, it is the smallest honeyeater in Australia.
It has a short tail and relatively long down-curved bill.
It is sexually dimorphic; the male is a striking bright red with black wings, while the female is entirely brown.
It is more vocal than most honeyeaters, and a variety of calls have been recorded, including a bell-like tinkling.
