 * Write a program that opens two files. You can obtain the filenames either by using

 * 	a. Have the program print line 1 of the first file, line 1 of the second file, line 2 of the 
 * 	first file, line 2 of the second file, and so on, until the last line of the longer file
 * 	(in terms of lines) is printed.
 *
 * 	b. Modify the program so that lines with the same line number are printed on the same line.
