1)	scanf() stops reading after it encounters the whitespace character after the first name.
	It stores that whitespace in the input. Now, the program encounters another scanf() and this time 
	it will start from that whitespace. This time the function expects to encounter a float value but,
	it encounters a whitespace. This stops the scanf() and thus no value is assigned to
	the weight variable. This leads to wrong calculations.
	
2)	a]	234.5
	b]	Hi!
	c]	His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar. 
		has 42 characters.
	d]	Is 1.20e3 the same as 1201.00 ?
	
3)	Change the string Q's symbolic constant declaration to #define Q "\"His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar.\""

4)	#include<stdio.h>
	#include<string.h>

	#define B "booboo"
	#define X 10

	int main(void)
	{
		int age;
		
		char name[40];
		
		int xp;
		
		printf("Please enter your first name.\n");
		
		scanf("%s", name);
		
		printf("All right, %s, what's your age?\n", name);
		
		scanf("%d", &age);
		
		xp = age + X;
		
		printf("That's a %c! You must be at least %d.\n", 'B', xp);
		
		
		return 0;
	}
	
5)	printf("This copy of \"%s\" sells for $%0.2f.\nThat is %0.0%% of list.", BOOK, cost, percent);

6)	a]	%d
	b]	%4X
	c]	%10.3f
	d]	%12.2e
	e]	%-30s

7)	a] %15lu
	b] %#4x
	c]	%-12.2E
	d]	%+10.3f
	e]	%8.8s

8)	a]	%6.4d
	b]	%*o
	c]	%2c
	d]	%+.2f
	e]	%-7.5s
	
9)	a]	int value;
		scanf("%d", &value);
		
	b]	float value1, value2;
		scanf("%f %f", &value1, &value2);
		
	c]	char value[40];
		scanf("%s", value);
	
	d]	char value[40];
		int integer;
		scanf("%s %d", value, &integer);
		
	e]	char value[40];
		int integer;
		scanf("%*s %d", &integer);
	

12) The replacement will take place but them it will happen for all the brackets 
	that have been assigned using #define
